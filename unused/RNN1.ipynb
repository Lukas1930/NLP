      "Malformed line skipped: Cheney was looking at maps of Iraq oil fields and muttering about opportunities for US companies there , already in January or February of 2001 .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Wolfowitz contradicted counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke when the latter spoke of the al - Qaeda threat , insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the US came from Iraq , and indicating he accepted Laurie Mylroie 's crackpot conspiracy theory that Saddam was behind the 1993 World Trade Towers bombing .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: If you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality -- that was an al - Qaeda operation mainly carried out by al - Gamaa al - Islamiyyah , an Egyptian terrorist component allied with Bin Laden -- then you will concentrate on the wrong threat .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Even after the attacks on September 11 , Bush was obsessing about Iraq .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50 % chance that Iraq was behind them .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: ( On what evidence ?\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: The hijackers were obviously al - Qaeda , and no operational links between al - Qaeda and Iraq had ever been found ) .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al - Qaeda bases in Afghanistan , saying there were \" no good targets \" in Afghanistan .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: ( What about 40 al - Qaeda bases that had trained the 9/11 hijackers and other terrorists gunning for the United States ?? )\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: The Pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with Afghanistan or al - Qaeda that it could pull off the shelf , according to Bob Woodward .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Bush did not have his eye on the ball .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Neither did Cheney , Rumsfeld , or Wolfowitz .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: They were playing Captain Ahab to Saddam 's great white whale .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Imperial Hubris makes the case that lots of people in the CIA and counter-terrorism divisions elsewhere in the US government knew all about Bin Laden and the threat he posed .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: They were from all accounts marginalized and not listened to .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Bush demoted Dick Clarke , among the most vocal and focused of the al - Qaeda experts , from his cabinet .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers , who outranked him , and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when George Tenet 's hair was \" on fire \" about the excited chatter the CIA was picking up from radical Islamist terrorists .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: As for the Clinton administration , let me say one thing in its defense .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Clinton had worked out a deal with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the US to send a Special Ops team in after Bin Laden in Qandahar , based from Pakistan .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: I presume you need the Pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: You also need Pakistani air space .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: The plan was all set and could have succeeded .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: But in fall of 1999 , Gen. Pervez Musharraf made a coup against Nawaz Sharif .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: The Pakistani army was rife with elements protective of the Taliban , and the new military government reneged on the deal .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Musharraf told Clinton he could n't use Pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against Bin Laden .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Look at a map and you try to figure out how , in fall of 1999 , you could possibly pull off such an operation without Pakistani facilities .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Of course , you could just go in by main force .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: But for those of you tempted in that direction , please look up Carter 's Tabas operation .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: It should be easily googled .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Clinton tried , and tried hard .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: The gods were n't with us on that one .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: On the internet site of Monotheism and Holy War ( al - Tawhid wa al - Jihad ) , the group allegedly declared , \" We announce that the Tawhid and Jihad Group , its prince and soldiers , have pledged allegiance to the sheikh of the mujahideen Osama bin Laden . \"\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: This pledge is a new development .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Abu Musab al - Zarqawi and his group are said to have been bitter rivals of al - Qaeda during the Afghan resistance days .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: One witness at the Moutasaddiq trial in Germany alleged that Zarqawi had not allowed Monotheism and Holy War to share resources with al - Qaeda in the early zeroes of the 21st century .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: If the statement is true , it is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being \" picked up \" by al - Qaeda .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: This consolidation is obviously a result of Bush 's aggressive invasion of Iraq and of the botching of the aftermath .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: It is a setback for the war on terror .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Al - Qaeda in Afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred \" Afghan Arabs \" who pledged personal loyalty to Usamah Bin Laden .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: It could notionally be expanded to encompass the 5,000 - strong \" 55th Brigade \" of the Taliban regime , though this is not the technical definition .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Because Usamah is Saudi , my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the Wahhabi school of Islam that predominates among Saudia 's some 15 million citizens .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: In 1998 they were joined by Egyptians from the al - Jihad al - Islami group of Ayman al - Zawahiri ( many of these were from Upper Egypt , especially Asyut and environs ) .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: After that point , al - Qaeda was a joint enterprise between the Egyptian extremists and the polyglot Arabs around Bin Laden , only some of whom were Saudi .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Zarqawi is a Jordanian , and his Monotheism and Holy War group in Afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly Jordanian , Palestinian and Syrian .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: They also had a special connection to some extremists in Jordan and Germany .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: They are probably especially oriented toward the Salafi school of modern Islamic thought , which has a Protestant - like emphasis on going back to the original practice of the early companions of the Prophet Muhammad .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: ( Most Salafis are not militant or violent , though they tend to be rather narrow - minded in my experience , on the order of Protestant Pietists ) .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Monotheism and Holy War obviously does have a violent interpretation of Salafism , rather as the the leaders of the so - called German Peasant Rebellion among early Protestants did .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Another worrisome sign is that local Iraqi Sunni fundamentalists opposed to the US presence in Iraq have begun joining Monotheism and Holy War , and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: These have been sighted among Iraqi crowds on Haifa Street in Baghdad and in Samarra .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: So now there are hundreds of al - Qaeda members in Iraq where there had been none before .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: The consolidation of smaller local radical fundamentalist groups with al - Qaeda can also be seen in the case of the Fizazi group in Tangiers that morphed into the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group , had members who met with September 11 ringleader Muhammad Atta , and ultimately was in part responsible for the Madrid train bombings .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: The Iraqi Islamic Party lead by Muhsin Abdul Hamid , has been among the few Sunni Muslim groups willing to cooperate ( even if rather lukewarmly ) with the Americans .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: It is now threatening to pull out of the Allawi caretaker government .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: The IIP had also been the main force urging Sunni Arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for January , and had been opposed in this stance by the Association of Muslim Scholars .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: That the Iraqi Islamic Party is now contemplating leaving the Allawi government raises the question of whether a mass Sunni Arab boycott of the elections is in the offing , thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of any new government .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Az - Zaman : The Association of Muslim Scholars forbade Iraqis to participate in the attack on Fallujah with the Americans .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: In a communique , the AMS said that for Iraqis to take part with \" raiding forces \" in the assault on a city , the population of which is Muslim ( such as Fallujah ) would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: The Sunni AMS told Iraqis , \" You sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on Najaf , and beware lest you repeat this same sin in Fallujah .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Remember that the Occupation is emphemeral . \"\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: The radical Shiite Sadr movement issued a statement forbidding the participation of Iraqi troops in the attack on Fallujah , as well .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: The statement said , \" We direct an appeal at the men in the Iraqi forces , whether national guards or others , the majority of whom are Muslim , calling upon them to refrain for commiting this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity , and we ask them to view this war as illegal . \"\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: It called a \" ploy \" the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at Fallujah .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: The convergence of views among the more militant Sunni Muslim clerics of AMS and the radical Shiites of the Sadr movement has been seen before , last spring during the initial US assault on Fallujah and during the US attack on Mahdi Army militiamen in Najaf .\n",
      "Malformed line skipped: Most Shiites , however , are still reluctant to take major risks to support the Sunnis of Fallujah , many of whom had supported Saddam and his anti-Shiite pogroms .\n",
